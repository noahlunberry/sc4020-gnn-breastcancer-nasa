There is nothing wrong with second place.
Your best effort is all that anyone's asking for.
And if you give your best and you come in second, you come in third, you come in last, it's not about winning or losing.
It's about giving it everything you've got.
Now, Sam has built a monument to devilry and chaos.
I deserve second place, I came in second.
The only crime that's been committed here is that Oscar and Ally deserve first.
We should be applauding them for getting more points.
But in this sick rodeo, this bizarre \textit{fucked up} clown festival that Sam's put together, we're here celebrating what I can only describe as the sickness at the core of America.
And I'm gonna get him, I'm gonna get Sam.

\section{Methods}
In order to accurately asseess the capability of two different graph networks, two diverese datasets were chosen. The two models were trained on each and evaluated.

\subsection{Datasets}

The two datasets used in this study are the NASA Turbofan Jet Engine Degradation dataset (C-MAPSS) and the UCI Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset \todo{add proper citations}. These were selected to reflect two distinct real-world problems. Prognostics of mechanical systems and medical diagnosis. This ensures diversity in the training data while reducing domain-specific bias.

The Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset consists of 32 columns. Two columns correspond to identifiers and diagnosis labels respectively.
The remaining 30 represent measurable tumor characteristics (e.g., radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, etc.). The target variable is the classification of the tumor as benign or malignant.
Prior to training, all numerical features were normalized to zero mean and unit variance to ensure convergence during training. The dataset was split into training and test sets using an 80/20 ratio.


The NASA C-MAPSS turbofan jet engine degradation dataset provides multivariate time-series data simulating total life scenarios of jet engines. Each engine instance is characterized by 26 columns: one engine identifier, one time cycle index, three operational condition variables, and 21 sensor measurements. The target variable is the Remaining Useful Life (RUL), defined as the number of cycles left until engine failure.

The dataset was provided with separate training and validation partitions: 100 engines for training and 100 engines for validation. For consistency, sensor features were normalized across engines.


The two datasets differ fundamentally both in data modality (tabular biomedical features vs. multivariate time-series sensor data) and in target type (classification vs. regression). This diversity was intentional, aiming to assess the generalizability of the evaluated models across domains.


\subsection{Models}
\subsubsection{Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)}
The Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) serves as a baseline model for learning from graph-structured data. A GCN updates node representations by aggregating feature information from neighboring nodes using a normalized graph Laplacian.

For the breast cancer dataset, nodes corresponded to patient samples, while the edges were the relations between these samples \todo{change i guess lol?}. Node features corresponded to the 30 tumor attributes, and the output task was binary classification.

For the turbofan dataset, nodes represented sensor states and operational conditions. Edges were defined through temporal adjacency and feature correlations. The GCN then predicted the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) as a regression task.

The GCN architecture consisted of \todo{insert number of layers} convolutional layers with \todo{activation functions, e.g., ReLU}, dropout for regularization, \todo{bro di dont know}.

\subsubsection{Graph Attention Network (GAT)}
The Graph Attention Network (GAT) extends the GCN by introducing an attention mechanism over neighboring nodes. Instead of averaging features uniformly, GAT learns attention coefficients that weight the contribution of each neighbor during aggregation. This allows the model to focus on the most informative relationships within the graph, which especially in datasets with high assumed covariance, can lead to significantly improved results.

The same graph structures described for the GCN were used for the GAT.

The GAT architecture consisted of \todo{insert number} attention layers with \todo{insert number} attention heads, followed by nonlinear activations (e.g., ELU), dropout.


\subsection{Training, Inference, and Evaluation}

Both models were trained under consistent experimental conditions.

\paragraph{Training Setup.}
The models were trained for 300 epochs using the mean square error

\paragraph{Inference.} After training, the best-performing model checkpoints were used for inference on the test datasets.

\paragraph{Evaluation Metrics.}
- For the breast cancer dataset: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC were reported.
- For the turbofan dataset: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the PHM challenge scoring function \todo{if used} were computed.
